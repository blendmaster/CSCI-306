# In Which the Most Excellent of Java Programming Spilled Forth From His Hands

This is almost all of the code I have had to write for [CSCI 306](http://mcs.mines.edu/Courses/csci306/) at the Colorado School of Mines. Thanks to the powers of GitHub, you may now feast your eyes upon my works, said by some to be wrought from pure gold. Metaphorical gold, anyway. The kind that isn't worth much anymore.

## But Seriously, Though

Some of this shit is pretty brilliant. I'll look back in a year and wonder what the hell I was thinking, but at this point in time, I'd totes launch, like, 980 ships for this code.
